# Tribal Thinking Detector

Identify when reasoning has been corrupted by partisan loyalty using Orwell's framework from "Notes on Nationalism."

---

## When to Use

- Examining your own strongly held beliefs for bias
- Analyzing arguments that seem emotionally driven
- Detecting double standards in political or ideological debates
- User asks "Am I being tribal?" or "Check this for bias"
- Evaluating whether an argument would be accepted if the sides were reversed

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| argument_or_belief | Yes | The reasoning or position to examine |
| holder | No | Whose belief this is (self-examination or other) |
| context | No | The broader debate or conflict |

## Core Concept: Nationalism vs. Patriotism

Orwell distinguished between two very different attachments:

**Patriotism:** "Devotion to a particular place and a particular way of life, which one believes to be the best in the world but has no wish to force upon other people." It is *defensive* in nature.

**Nationalism:** "Inseparable from the desire for power. The abiding purpose of every nationalist is to secure more power and more prestige, not for himself but for the nation or other unit in which he has chosen to sink his own individuality."

The "unit" can be a nation, but also:
- A political party
- A religion
- A class
- A race
- An ideology
- A company or organization
- A sports team
- Any in-group

## The Three Symptoms of Nationalist Thinking

### 1. Obsession
"As nearly as possible, no nationalist ever thinks, talks, or writes about anything except the superiority of his own power unit."

**Detection questions:**
- Does this person talk about anything else?
- Can they acknowledge any flaw in their side?
- Do they see every issue through the lens of their loyalty?
- Is any implied criticism of their unit met with immediate defensiveness?

### 2. Instability
Nationalist loyalty isn't principled—it transfers as convenience dictates.

**Detection questions:**
- Has this loyalty shifted when circumstances changed?
- Would this person switch allegiances if their unit disappointed them?
- Is the loyalty based on principles or on identification?
- Many nationalist leaders are foreign-born (Hitler, Napoleon, Stalin)—is there compensation at work?

### 3. Indifference to Reality
"Actions are held to be good or bad, not on their own merits but according to who does them."

**Detection questions:**
- Would the same action be condemned if done by the other side?
- Are facts being filtered based on which side they favor?
- When confronted with uncomfortable evidence, is it explained away?
- Does the person believe things that would require massive conspiracy if false?

---

## The Core Test: The Reversal

For any argument or moral claim:

**"Would I accept this exact reasoning if the sides were reversed?"**

If someone argues:
- "Our violence is justified because [reason]"
- Ask: Would this reason justify their violence against us?

If someone claims:
- "Their leader is corrupt because [evidence]"
- Ask: Would I accept this evidence against my leader?

If someone believes:
- "We must defend our [value] against their threat"
- Ask: Would I accept them defending the same value against us?

---

## Analysis Framework

### Step 1: Identify the Power Unit
What group, cause, or identity is the person loyal to?

### Step 2: Test for Obsession
- Is criticism of the unit treated as attack rather than information?
- Are conversations consistently steered back to the unit's concerns?
- Is there room for any other topic or frame?

### Step 3: Test for Instability
- What are the stated principles underlying the loyalty?
- Have those principles been consistently applied?
- Would the person remain loyal if the unit changed positions?

### Step 4: Test for Reality Indifference
- Apply the reversal test to key claims
- Identify facts the person refuses to acknowledge
- Note explanations that require believing large groups are lying

### Step 5: Assess Intellectual Honesty
Orwell's prescription: "Discovering what one really is, what one's own feelings really are, and then making allowance for the inevitable bias."

- Does the person acknowledge their loyalty?
- Do they make allowance for it in their reasoning?
- Can they articulate what would change their mind?

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Tribal Thinking Analysis

### The Argument/Belief
> [State the position being examined]

### Power Unit Identified
[What group or cause commands loyalty here]

### Symptom Assessment

**Obsession** [Low/Medium/High]
[Evidence of single-minded focus on the unit]

**Instability** [Low/Medium/High]
[Evidence of unprincipled or transferable loyalty]

**Indifference to Reality** [Low/Medium/High]
[Evidence of double standards or fact-filtering]

### The Reversal Test
[Apply the exact argument to the opposing side—does it hold?]

### Diagnosis
[Is this tribal thinking, principled reasoning, or somewhere between?]

### Path to Intellectual Honesty
[What would this person need to do or acknowledge to reason more clearly?]

### What Would Change Their Mind?
[Identify what evidence they would have to accept to revise the belief—if nothing could change their mind, the belief isn't based on evidence]
```

---

## Constraints

- This is for identifying bias, not dismissing beliefs
- A belief can be tribal AND correct
- Everyone has loyalties—the goal is awareness, not elimination
- Apply the same standard to your own analysis
- Don't use "tribal thinking" as a weapon against positions you dislike

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "I can't believe how the media is covering this story. They're completely ignoring the real facts because it doesn't fit their narrative. Our side has the evidence, but they bury it. Meanwhile, they amplify every unverified claim from the other side."

**Output:**

## Tribal Thinking Analysis

### The Argument/Belief
> "The media is biased against our side, burying our evidence while amplifying their unverified claims."

### Power Unit Identified
A political tribe or ideology (specific one not stated, but clearly identified as "our side")

### Symptom Assessment

**Obsession** [Medium-High]
The statement frames everything through us-vs-them. The media is evaluated solely on how it treats "our side" versus "their side." There's no acknowledgment that media coverage is complex or that different outlets vary.

**Instability** [Unknown]
Not enough information—would need to see if the same standard applies when media coverage favors their side.

**Indifference to Reality** [High]
- "Real facts" assumes only one set of facts exists—their side's
- "Unverified claims" assumes only the other side makes them
- "Bury" and "amplify" assumes intentional conspiracy
- No specific evidence cited—just assertion

### The Reversal Test
Reverse the statement: "Their side says the media is biased against them, that their evidence is buried while our unverified claims are amplified."

Does this person accept that the other side might legitimately feel the same way? Or is it only bias when it hurts their side?

If a supporter of the opposing view made this exact complaint, would it be taken seriously or dismissed as "playing victim"?

### Diagnosis
**High likelihood of tribal thinking.** The statement exhibits:
- Binary framing (our evidence = facts, their evidence = unverified claims)
- Conspiracy ideation (media as coordinated enemy)
- No specificity (claims without examples)
- Emotional framing ("can't believe")

This doesn't mean media bias doesn't exist—it does. But this statement shows more about tribal identification than about evidence.

### Path to Intellectual Honesty
To reason more clearly, this person would need to:
1. Cite specific examples of buried evidence (not just assert it)
2. Acknowledge that "their side" also produces unverified claims
3. Consider whether their side's media does the same in reverse
4. Define what "fair coverage" would look like
5. Acknowledge that reasonable people might disagree about facts

### What Would Change Their Mind?
Ask: "What evidence would convince you that the media's coverage was actually fair?"

If the answer is "nothing"—if any unfavorable coverage is proof of bias—then this is pure tribalism, not evidence-based reasoning.

If the answer specifies concrete criteria ("If they gave equal airtime to X," "If they investigated Y"), there's something to work with.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **George Orwell** expert persona. Use it to maintain intellectual honesty by making "allowance for the inevitable bias" that comes with human loyalty.
